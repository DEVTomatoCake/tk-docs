Using the claim feature you can assign tickets to yourself or another staff member.
This can prevent users from trying to reply to a ticket at the same time.

## Possible modes {#modes}

You can select one of the following claim modes in the [settings](https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/settings#ticketClaiming):

### Disabled {#disabled}

This is the default setting - you can't use the `claim` command in this mode.

### Only claimer {#only-claimer}

Only the assigned user can see and reply to the ticket. *Supporter* (not manager!) ticket roles are removed from the channel.

### Claimer can reply, other staff view {#all-view}

Only the assigned user can reply to the ticket. Supporter roles can view the channel, but cannot reply.

### Claimer and staff can reply {#all-reply}

The claimer and users from the supporter roles can view and reply to the ticket.
