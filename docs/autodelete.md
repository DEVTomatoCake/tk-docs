You can select channels in which the messages will be deleted after the given time (Â± one minute).

This setting is useful for e.g. advertising channels by deleting messages for example after six hours.

## Settings per channel {#settings}

The time is set using the bots default time format:
- `5m`: Five minutes
- `1h30m`: One hour and 30 minutes
- `6h`: Six hours after the message was sent

You can enter a time of up to one year.
