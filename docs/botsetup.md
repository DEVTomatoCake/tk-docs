# [Invite TomatenKuchen](https://tomatenkuchen.eu/invite)

You can invite the bot using [this invite link](https://tomatenkuchen.eu/invite). You'll automatically be logged in into the dashboard which allows you to modify server settings. These settings include the language and prefixes in addition to slash commands.

## You have to enter an "ID"?

To copy an ID right click the message, the user, the channel or the server. If there's no option to copy the ID, make sure you have the developer mode enabled. To do that, follow [the tutorial by Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).
