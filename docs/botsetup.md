To copy an ID right click the message, the user, the channel or the server. If there's no option to copy the ID, make sure you have the developer mode enabled.

## Command syntax {#syntax}

Commands are always displayed as `command-name <Required argument> Required|argument|with|options [<Optional argument>] <...Argument which allows spaces>`.

:::warning Brackets

Make sure to omit the brackets when using arguments, they are only used for highlighting.

:::

Slash commands use a different syntax, however to options displayed on Discord are usually self-explanatory.
