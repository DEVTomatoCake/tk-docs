description: This page tells some general information about the bot.
---

The Discord bot was created by TomatoCake in March 2020 and is contiontiosly being developed since. Almost daily ~~bugs~~ features are fixed and new features added or existing ones improved.

The bot is developed only by TomatoCake - though some users have helped with the dashboard, some commands and translation.
For an overview of all contributors can be found on the [credits](https://tomatenkuchen.com/credits) page.

## Name {#name}

The name "TomatenKuchen" is simply the translation of "TomatoCake".

:::tip Name too complicated?

Many non-German users don't want to guess how the name is spelled properly - simply use "tk" or "TK" instead!
