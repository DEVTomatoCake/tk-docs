The Discord app was created by TomatoCake in March 2020 and is contiontiosly being developed since. Almost daily ~~bugs~~ features are fixed and new features added or existing ones improved.

The app is developed by TomatoCake only, however some users have helped with the dashboard, commands and translating it.
For an overview of all contributors can be found on the [credits](https://tomatenkuchen.com/credits) page.

## Name {#name}

The name "TomatenKuchen" is simply the translation of "TomatoCake".

:::tip Name too complicated?

Many non-German users don't want to guess how the name is spelled properly - simply use "tk" or "TK" instead!
