- `{usersWithRole:<id>}`: Amount of members with a specific role. Replace `<id>` with a role ID.

# Stats on the bot website and `stats`

Example: [Vanilla Minigames statistics](https://tomatenkuchen.eu/stats/?guild=608640398595719170)

TomatenKuchen collects daily statistics of your server. These include:
- Member count
- Messages per day
- Boost count
- Active chatter amount (how many unique users sent a message on your server that day)

## Possible filters
Filter werden als Query-Parameter an die URL angeh√§ngt: `https://tomatenkuchen.eu/stats/?guild=608640398595719170?type=messages&time=2w`. Die Verwendung der `?` und `&` in dieser Form ist wichtig.

- `type`: Only shows the specified stat type.
	- `?type=members`: Member count
	- `?type=messages`: Messages per day
	- `?type=boosts`: Boost count
	- `?type=chatters`: Active chatter amount
- `time`: Only shows statistics within the given time span:
	- `?time=1mo`: Only shows statistics of the last months.

Those options can also be used for the `stats` command. The command also generates an URL for easier sharing.
