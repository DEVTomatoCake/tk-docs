Because privacy is important to us, the bot has a feature to easily view all stored data of the currently logged in user.

To view the data export, simply visit https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/dataexport - you can find a clear visualization of your data there.

At the end of the page you can find the unprocessed content which is often taken without any changes from the database.
The JSON file contains even more information and can be used to export e.g. reminders and [forms](/forms).
