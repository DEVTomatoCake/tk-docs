Using the starboard members can save funny or otherwise interesting messages forever: Every user on the server can react with the set emoji onto a message.

Once the set amount of "stars" is reached, the message is sent to the starboard channel.

Images are stored outside of Discord to allow displaying them even if the original source image was deleted.
