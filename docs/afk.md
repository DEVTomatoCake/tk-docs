The AFK/Away-from-keyboard system can be used to indicate the absence of an account.

When a user marked as AFK is mentioned, the bot will display the message set by the user. Once the AFK user sends a message, they will be shown a list of all mentions.

You can use the parameter `{afk}` in [Autoupdate](./autoupdate) messages to display a list of the currently AFK users.

# Settings

## AFK role
You can select an AFK role which will be given to users marked as AFK.
