The AFK/Away-from-keyboard system can be used to indicate the absence of a user.

Users can enable being AFK using the `afk` command.

When a user marked as AFK is mentioned, the bot will display the message set by the user. Once the AFK user sends a message, they will be shown a list of all mentions.

You can use the parameter `{afk}` in [Autoupdate](/autoupdate) messages to display a list of the currently AFK users.

## AFK role

You can select an AFK role in the server settings which will be given to users marked as AFK.
