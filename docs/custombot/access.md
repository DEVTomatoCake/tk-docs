:::info Beta version
Custom bots are still in beta and may contain errors.
However, everyone may test the beta version by joining the [Discord server](https://tomatenkuchen.com/discord).
:::

## Bot team

If you want to allow multiple users access to the bot, before adding the bot in the TomatenKuchen dashboard, create a team in the Discord developer portal and add the bot to it.
Then you invite other users using the "Members" tab and give them permission roles.

Your custom bot automatically updates this list periodically.

### Roles

- Admin: Full access
- Read-only: Read-only
- Other roles: Full access except deleting the bot

## Managing

You can see custom bots you own, you have access to or you are paying for in the [custom bot dashboard](https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/custom).

Users that are only set as paying users can only remove themselves from that position, other actions are disabled.

:::warning

Note that the bot goes offline if there's no paying user left or none of the remaining ones have enough credits.
