title: Getting IDs
description: A short explanation of how to get the Discord ID ("snowflake")
---

To get an ID (or "snowflake"), right click the message, user, emoji, channel, role, or server you want to get the ID from.
If you've already enabled the developer, there's a button "Copy ID" to copy the ID to your clipboard.

If there's no option to copy the ID, make sure you have the developer mode enabled.
To do that, follow [the tutorial by Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).

If there's a respective bot command, you can also use it to get the ID, e.g. `message id`, `user`, `emoji info`, `channel info`, `role info`, and `server`.
