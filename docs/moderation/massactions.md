## Ban users

`mass ban <Reason> <List of users, separated by " ", "," or ";">`

## Kick users

`mass kick <Reason> <List of users, separated by " ", "," or ";">`

## Add role to many users

`role massadd <Role> [<Filter>]`

## Remove role from many users

`role massremove <Role> [<Filter>]`

## Dehoist

Dehoisting, which means the removal of unnormal characters at the beginning of usernames, can either be started using the `dehoist`
command or by enabling the related setting.
If the setting for automatic dehoisting is enabled, the bot will automatically run the command once a day.
