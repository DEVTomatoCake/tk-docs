YouTube notificiations allow sending a message when the user uploads a new video or short to YouTube.
If a user schedules a video or livestream, the bot will also announce it.

You can get the YouTube user ID using the `youtube` command or using the "Share" button on a channels info page.

The bot checks for new items every 10 minutes, due to YouTube limiting the feeds it rarely may take a bit longer.

Every server can add up to ten different users and receive notifications for them.
