With this bot, you can manage your Pterodactyl (https://pterodactyl.io) panel servers from Discord.

# Setup:

`/setup <Panel URL main/server list url> <API Key> [<Alias>] [default]`

An "alias" refers to a single panel. With aliases you can use multiple Pterodactyl panels at the same time.
If you don't use an alias, the bot will auto generate one for you.

The bot can also run quick actions on the server:

# `/console` and `/command`

Those commands can be used to view the server console of a server and running commands on them. Note that a server has to be online to be able to execute commands on it.
