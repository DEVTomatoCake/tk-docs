With this bot, you can manage your Pterodactyl (https://pterodactyl.io) panel servers from Discord.

# Setup:

`/setup <Panel URL main/server list url> <API Key> [<Alias>] [default]`

An "alias" refers to a single panel. With aliases you can use multiple Pterodactyl panels at the same time.
If you don't use an alias, the bot will auto generate one for you.
