description: Dies ist ein Feature, um eine gesendete Nachricht anhand eines Links zu zitieren.
---

Using this [setting](https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/settings#quoteDiscordLink) you can change whether and if so, how messages can be quoted from the current server:

- Disabled: Disables the quoting of messages. Message links sent on this server, as well as message links that link to a message on the current server, are ignored.
- Only this server: Allows the quoting of messages that link to the current server. Message links that are sent on other servers are ignored.
- Always: Allows quoting all messages.

## Permissions {#permissions}

The bot requires the permissions "Send messages" and "Embed links" in the channel where the message should be quoted.

In channels where a message is quoted, the permissions "View channel" and "View message history" are required.
