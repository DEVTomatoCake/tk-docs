title: Birthdays
description: TomatenKuchen is a multipurpose Discord bot with many common and innovative features for your server. The birthday system allows creating birthday per user and per server. You can also create birthday calendars and customized reminders.
---

Birthday messages are sent daily in the set server timezone at 0 o'clock (midnight).

## Real users {#users}

### Set/edit birthday {#create}

Every user can set their global birthday using `birthday set <Day> <Month> [<Year>] [public]`.

The year is optional, if used the birthday messages and [auto updating messages](/autoupdate) can use the variable `{age}`, which displays the new age. If the age is not set, the age variable is left empty.

Using the `public` option you can toggle whether the birthday is shown on the `user` command and the `{birthday}` argument for autoupdating messages.
This doesn't affect birthday announcements.

- `birthday set 29 2 2000 public`
	- Sets a public birthday which is announced every year on 02/29. If the year is not a leap year, the message will appear on 03/01.
- `birthday set 1 4`
	- Sets a not public birthday which is announced every year on 04/01.

### Delete birthday {#delete}

If you want to delete your birthday, use the command `birthday delete`.

## Fictive birthdays {#fictive}

Fictive birthdays are per server and can be configured by server moderators.

### Creating or updating {#fictive-create}

`birthday setfictive <Name> <Day> <Month> [<Year>]`
Fictive birthdays must have a name set to identify them. Using this name birthday messages are created - the arguments stay the same, the bot automatically changes them to fit - and `{birthday}` generated.

- `birthday setfictive Minecraft 17 5 2009`
