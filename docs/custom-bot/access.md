:::info Beta version
Custom bots are still in beta and may contain errors.
However, everyone may test the beta version by joining the [Discord server](https://tomatenkuchen.com/discord).
:::

## Bot team

If you want to allow multiple users access to the bot, create a team in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and add the bot to it.
Then you can invite other users using the "Members" tab and give them permission roles.

Your custom bot automatically updates this list periodically - note that it might take up to two hours until newly added members have access.

### Roles

- Admin: Full access
- Read-only: Read-only
- Other roles: Full access except deleting the bot

## Managing

You can see custom bots you own, you have access to or you are paying for in the [custom bot dashboard](https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/custom).

Users that are only set as paying users can only remove themselves from that position, other actions are disabled.

:::warning

Note that the bot goes offline if there's no paying user left or none of the remaining ones have enough credits.
