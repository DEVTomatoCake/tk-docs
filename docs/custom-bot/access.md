:::info Beta version
Custom bots are still in beta and may contain errors.
However, everyone may test the beta version by joining the [Discord server](https://tomatenkuchen.com/discord).
:::

## Bot team

If you want to allow multiple users access to the bot, create a team in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and add the bot to it.
Then you can invite other users using the "Members" tab and give them permission roles.

Your custom bot automatically updates this list periodically - note that it might take up to two hours until newly added members have access.

### Roles

- Admin: Full access
- Read-only: Read-only
- Other roles: Full access except deleting the bot

## Managing

You can see custom bots you own or you have access to in the [custom bot dashboard](https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/custom).

:::warning

Note that the custom bot goes offline if the balance of it reaches zero, after sending several warning messages.
