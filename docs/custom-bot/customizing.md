:::info Beta version
Custom bots are still in beta and may contain errors.
However, everyone may test the beta version by joining the [Discord server](https://tomatenkuchen.com/discord).
:::

For custom bots, you can freely change the following display settings of the bot:
- Name
- Avatar
- About me

You can make those changes either in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) or in the [custom bot dashboard](https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/custom).

The status can be changed with an [upgrade](./upgrades) - this way, you can set all kind of activities and an interval in which the status should get changed. If you don't have this upgrade, the status contains a TomatenKuchen advertisement.
