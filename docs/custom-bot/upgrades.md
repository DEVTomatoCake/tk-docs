:::info Beta version
Custom bots are still in beta and may contain errors.
However, everyone may test the beta version by joining the [Discord server](https://tomatenkuchen.com/discord).
:::

You can find the prices of upgrades on the [Custom bot info page](https://tomatenkuchen.com/custom#upgrades).

The following upgrades can be enabled and configured in the [Dashboard](https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/custom):
- Status
	- If enabled, you can freely change the bot status. This includes the text, the activity (Playing/Custom/â€¦) and the status (Online/Idle/Do not disturb/Offline).
	- If "Streaming" is selected, the status text must include a twitch.tv streamer link. On Discord, instead of being shown in the text, it's displayed as a link with a stream preview as status. If the streamer isn't live, the link redirects to the channel of the streamer.
- Responding to other bots
	- If enabled, the bot reacts to other bots. Depending on the amount of messages that have to be processed by these bots, the daily credit price increases. Bots may not be able to execute all actions or commands. Also note that bots have a higher command cooldown.
