:::info Beta version
Custom bots are still in beta and may contain errors.
However, everyone may test the beta version by joining the [Discord server](https://tomatenkuchen.com/discord).
:::

Using a custom bot, you can get your own version of TomatenKuchen on your server without it being obvious that it's TomatenKuchen.

## What's that? {#about}

Custom bots, also known as "Custom branding" or "White-label" from other bots, allow you to use a bot created by you with the features of TomatenKuchen.
The advantage of this is that you can enjoy all the great [TomatenKuchen features](/features), but your server members can only see your bot, not TomatenKuchen.

You can also run different bots alongside the TomatenKuchen custom bot by using its token multiple times.
Do note however that we cannot provide support for this and it may cause problems with interactions, like slash commands or buttons.

## Setup {#setup}

To create a custom bot, simply open the [custom bot dashboard](https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/custom) and click on "Create".

The page then guides you step-by-step through the setup process.

You can obtain the bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You can either create a new bot specifically for the custom bot (recommended to prevent conflicts), or use an existing one.

## Payment

:::info Free custom bot

The first custom bot is free for everyone. You can use it for as long as you want without any costs.

:::

The payment works with credits, a virtual currency of TomatenKuchen. Credits can be earned mostly by voting and participating in giveaways on the TomatenKuchen Discord.
You can also earn them by using the economy system and contributing to the bot, for example, as a translator or by providing suggestions.

The price depends on the total member count of all the servers you add the bot to. This means you can use your bot **on multiple servers simultaneously** - something that most other custom bot providers do not allow.

If your bot is online, once a day the current value is deducted from your account. Therefore, your bot should be set to "Private" in the Discord Developer Portal to prevent other users from inviting it and causing you high costs.

The current credit prices, along with an automatic calculator, are listed on the [custom bot info page](https://tomatenkuchen.com/custom).
The price is always rounded down to the nearest integer.
