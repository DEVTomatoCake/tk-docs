:::info Beta version
Custom bots are still in beta and may contain errors.
However, everyone may test the beta version by joining the [Discord server](https://tomatenkuchen.com/discord).
:::

Using a custom bot, you can get your own version of TomatenKuchen on your server without it being obvious that it's TomatenKuchen.

## What's that?

Custom bots, also known as "Custom branding" or "White-label" from other bots, means that you can use a bot created by you with the features of TomatenKuchen.
The advantage of this is, that you can use all of the great [TomatenKuchen features](./features), but your server members can only see your bot, not TomatenKuchen.

You also can run different bots in addition to the TomatenKuchen custom bot on the same bot by using its token multiple times.
Do note however that we cannot provide support for this and it may cause problems with interactions, like slash commands or buttons.

## Setup

To create a custom bot, simply open the [custom bot dashboard](https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/custom) and click on "Create".

The page then guides you step-by-step through the setup process.

You can get the bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), you can either create a new bot only for the custom bot (recommended to prevent conflicts) or use an existing one.

## Payment

:::info Free custom bot

The first custom bot is free for everyone, you can use it as long as you want without any costs.

:::

The payment works with credits, a virtual currency of TomatenKuchen. Credits can be received mostly by voting and in giveaways on the TomatenKuchen Discord.
You can also get them by using the economy system and helping with the bot, e.g. as translator or by creating suggestions for the bot.

The price depends on the total member count of all servers you add the bot to. This means you are able to use your bot **on multiple servers at the same time** - most other custom bot providers don't allow that.

If your bot is online, once a day the current value is deducted from your account. Therefore, your bot should be set to "Private" in the Discord Developer Portal to prevent other users from inviting it and causing you high costs.

The current credit prices are, including an automatic calculator, listed on the [custom bot info page](https://tomatenkuchen.com/custom).
The price is always rounded down to the next integer.
