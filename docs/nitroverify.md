title: Nitro verification
description: TomatenKuchen is a multipurpose Discord bot with a lot of features. Grant your members with Discord Nitro a special role.
---

Using this feature members can be assigned a role if they have Discord Nitro (including basic) when running the command.

There must be a role selected for this in the settings. If it is, you can start the verification using the command `misc nitroverify`.

The bot will reply to you with a message which you have to react on using an animated emoji.
If another user reacts onto the message the verification is invalid and you don't receive the role.
