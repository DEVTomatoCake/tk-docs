title: Nitro verification
description: TomatenKuchen is a multipurpose Discord bot with many common and innovative features for your server. Grant your members with Discord Nitro a special role.
---

Using this feature you can assign members a role if they have Discord Nitro when running the command.

There must be a role selected for this in the settings. If it is, you can start the verification using the command `misc nitroverify`.

The bot will reply to you with a message which you have to react on using an animated emoji.
If another user reacts onto the message the verification is invalid and you don't receive the role.
