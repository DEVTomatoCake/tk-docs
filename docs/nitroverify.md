title: Nitro verification
description: Grant your members with Discord Nitro a special role.
---

Using this feature members can be assigned a role if they have Discord Nitro (including basic) when running the command.

You have to select a role for this feature in the [settings](https://tomatenkuchen.com/dashboard/settings#nitroVerifyRole).
Once it is users can start the verification using the command `misc nitroverify`.

The app will reply to you with a message which you have to react on using an animated emoji.
If another user reacts onto the message, the verification is invalid and you don't receive the role.
